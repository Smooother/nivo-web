NIVO GROUP – INVESTMENT & STRATEGY OVERVIEW
A portfolio of actively managed Swedish SMEs with tech-enhanced sourcing and AI-supported value creation

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY – The opportunity in short
- As the macro climate normalizes, pressure mounts on businesses to deliver sustainable, profitable, and efficient growth.
- Simultaneously, we’re entering a second wave of digitalization — unlocking new operational levers through AI, automation, and structured data.
- Nivo captures this opportunity by targeting stable, profitable Swedish SMEs with solid fundamentals, low volatility, and potential for modern efficiency gains.
- Our edge lies in our internal, proprietary data platform, which allows us to scan thousands of companies across Sweden through a financial-first lens — surfacing acquisition targets others miss.
- Once a refined list of ~50 companies is established, we engage in traditional, human-first outreach — building relationships with owners and exploring value creation together.
- Backed by long-term capital and operational experience, we aim to build a portfolio of high-quality Nordic SMEs and deliver 4–5x MoM returns.

WHY NOW – Efficient growth is the new normal — AI is the new lever
Era             | 2010–2020        | 2021–2023         | 2024–Beyond
--------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- | -------------------
Capital cost    | Very low         | High              | Normalizing
Strategy        | Growth at all costs | Profit obsession | Efficient growth
Behavior        | Scale quickly    | Freeze/cut        | Smart scale
Focus           | Topline          | Margins           | Both

AI and automation now offer:
- +5–10% topline growth in digitally enabled consumer sectors
- –30–40% cost savings in overhead-heavy domains (e.g., finance, legal, support)
