| `profit` | TEXT | **REAL** | 8,479 / 8,479 (100%) |
| `employees` | TEXT | **INTEGER** | 8,479 / 8,479 (100%) |

## Verification Results

### Data Integrity ✅
- **Total companies:** 8,479
- **Companies with revenue:** 8,479 (100%)
- **Companies with profit:** 8,479 (100%)
- **Companies with employees:** 8,479 (100%)

### Statistical Summary
- **Revenue range:** 15,005 - 149,913 SEK

### Sample Data (Verified)
```
Company: zeb.consulting AB
  Revenue:   66,284 SEK (was TEXT: '66284')
  Profit:    4,618 SEK (was TEXT: '4618')
  Employees: 20 (was TEXT: '20')

Company: Nordlo Syd AB
  Revenue:   96,921 SEK (was TEXT: '96921')
  Profit:    4,779 SEK (was TEXT: '4779')
  Employees: 48 (was TEXT: '48')
```

## Backup Created

**Backup file:** `allabolag.db.backup_before_type_conversion_20251007_165952`  
**Size:** 47 MB  
**Location:** `/Users/jesper/nivo/`

## Migration Process

1. ✅ Created timestamped backup
2. ✅ Added new columns with correct types (revenue_numeric, profit_numeric, employees_numeric)
3. ✅ Converted and copied all 8,479 records
4. ✅ Created new table with correct schema
5. ✅ Swapped tables (dropped old, renamed new)
6. ✅ Verified 100% data integrity

## Impact on Supabase Migration

### Problem Identified
The Supabase migration previously failed because:
- Source columns were TEXT in SQLite
- Target columns expected numeric types in Supabase
- **Result:** Only 214/8,438 companies (2.5%) had revenue data in Supabase

### Solution Ready
Now that local database has proper types:
- ✅ Revenue: REAL (numeric)
- ✅ Profit: REAL (numeric)
- ✅ Employees: INTEGER (numeric)
- ✅ 100% data coverage verified

**Next step:** Re-migrate to Supabase with proper type conversion will now succeed.

## Files Modified

### Scripts Created
- `/Users/jesper/nivo/backend/fix_local_db_types.py` - Type conversion script

### Database Files
- `/Users/jesper/nivo/allabolag.db` - ✅ Fixed (revenue, profit, employees now numeric)
- `/Users/jesper/nivo/allabolag.db.backup_before_type_conversion_20251007_165952` - Backup

## Validation Query

To verify the fix at any time:
```sql
-- Check column types
PRAGMA table_info(master_analytics);

-- Check data coverage
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total,
    COUNT(revenue) as with_revenue,
    COUNT(profit) as with_profit,
    COUNT(employees) as with_employees,
    AVG(revenue) as avg_revenue,
    AVG(profit) as avg_profit,
    AVG(employees) as avg_employees
FROM master_analytics;
```

## Next Steps

1. **Ready for Supabase Migration** 
   - Re-run migration with proper numeric types
   - Expected: 8,438+ companies with 100% financial data
   
2. **Update Supabase Schema** (if needed)
   - Ensure revenue, profit, employees columns are numeric types
   
3. **Verify Migration**
   - Confirm 100% data coverage in Supabase
   - Update TEST_RESULTS.md with corrected statistics

---

**Status:** Local database is now properly structured with 100% data coverage and correct types. Ready for Supabase migration.
