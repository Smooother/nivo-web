- **Solution:** Fixed schema and migrated with correct types

---

## 🔧 **Issues Fixed**

### 1. Local Database Types ✅
**Problem:** Revenue, profit, employees stored as TEXT  
**Solution:** Converted to proper types (REAL, REAL, INTEGER)  
**Script:** `backend/fix_local_db_types.py`

### 2. Supabase Schema ✅
**Problem:** Revenue/profit columns were DATE/TIMESTAMP types  
**Solution:** Recreated table with DOUBLE PRECISION  
**Script:** `backend/fix_supabase_schema_simple.sql`

### 3. Data Type Conversions ✅
**Problems:**
- NaN values breaking JSON serialization
- Date format issues (DD.MM.YYYY → YYYY-MM-DD)
- Integer vs Float type mismatches
- Duplicate OrgNr causing upsert conflicts

**Solutions:**
- Proper NaN/Infinity handling
- Date format conversion
- Explicit integer type conversion
- Deduplication before upload

### 4. Row Level Security ✅
**Problem:** RLS policies only allowed SELECT, blocked INSERT  
**Solution:** Added temporary INSERT/UPDATE policies  
**Script:** `backend/fix_rls_for_migration.sql`

## 🎯 **Impact on Dashboard**

### Before
- Dashboard showed "Companies with Financials: 998 (11.8%)"
- Revenue/profit data was missing for 88% of companies
- Analytics were incomplete and misleading

### After
- Dashboard will show "Companies with Financials: 8,436 (100%)"
- Complete financial data for all companies
- Accurate analytics and insights

### Frontend Updates Needed
The `frontend/src/lib/analyticsService.ts` was checking for:
```typescript
.not('Revenue_growth', 'is', null)
```

This should now be updated to check:
```typescript
.not('revenue', 'is', null)
```

Since `revenue` column now has 100% coverage instead of relying on KPI proxy.

## 📝 **Migration Process Summary**

### Phase 1: Diagnosis ✅
1. Discovered local DB had 100% data but TEXT types
2. Found Supabase had wrong schema (DATE types for revenue/profit)
3. Identified only 2.5% data coverage in Supabase

### Phase 2: Local Fix ✅
1. Created backup: `allabolag.db.backup_before_type_conversion_20251007_165952`
2. Converted TEXT → REAL/INTEGER
3. Verified 100% coverage maintained

### Phase 3: Supabase Fix ✅
1. Created backup table in Supabase
2. Dropped and recreated `master_analytics` with correct types
3. Added RLS policies for migration

### Phase 4: Migration ✅
1. Exported 8,479 companies from local DB
2. Cleaned data (NaN, dates, integers)
3. Deduplicated (8,479 → 8,436 unique)
4. Imported in 17 batches of 500
5. Verified 100% coverage

---

## 🔒 **Security Cleanup**

### Optional: Remove Temporary RLS Policies

After migration, you can remove the temporary INSERT/UPDATE policies:

```sql
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow insert during migration" ON master_analytics;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow update during migration" ON master_analytics;
```

The existing `"Allow public read access"` policy is sufficient for the frontend.
