# Scraper UI Enhancement Branch Notes

- **Branch name**: `scraper-ui-enhancement`
- **Context files reviewed**:
  - `scraper/CODEX_ANALYSIS_PROMPT.md`
  - `scraper/CURRENT_SYSTEM_ANALYSIS.md`
- **Focus areas pulled from the prompts**:
  - Design a monitoring-oriented UI that can surface real-time progress, bottlenecks, and error details for long-running scraping jobs handling 10k-50k companies.
  - Re-evaluate the multi-stage scraping architecture (segmentation, ID resolution, financial fetching) for scale, resilience, and observability.
  - Introduce robust checkpointing, retry, and session-management strategies so scrapes can resume after interruptions and run for 2-10 hours reliably.
  - Upgrade storage, queueing, and worker orchestration to handle higher concurrency, rate-limiting constraints, and concurrent jobs without SQLite limitations.
- **Next steps**: Draft architecture and UI proposals aligned with the above focus areas, then iterate with stakeholders for validation.
