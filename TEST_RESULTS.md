# AI Analysis Branch Test Results

## âœ… Setup Completed Successfully

**Date:** October 7, 2025  
**Branch:** `test-ai-analysis`  
**Status:** Ready for Testing

## Database Connection - WORKING âœ…

### Connection Details
- **Supabase URL:** https://clysgodrmowieximfaab.supabase.co
- **Database:** `master_analytics` table
- **Total Companies:** 8,438
- **Companies with Financials:** 998
- **Companies with KPIs:** 998
- **Companies with Digital Presence:** 952
- **Last Updated:** 2024-12-31

### Issues Fixed
1. âœ… **Missing `id` column** - Removed from query
2. âœ… **Missing `industry_name` column** - Mapped to `segment_name`
3. âœ… **Missing extended columns** - Removed non-existent enrichment fields
4. âœ… **Environment variables** - Vite now loading `.env.local` correctly

### Final Column Schema
The following columns are being queried from Supabase:
```
- OrgNr (primary key)
- name, address, city
- incorporation_date, email, homepage
- segment, segment_name
- revenue, profit, employees
- SDI, DR, ORS (financial metrics)
- Revenue_growth, EBIT_margin, NetProfit_margin
- analysis_year
```

## Ready to Test

### AI Analysis Features
- âœ… Natural language company search
- âœ… Template-based analysis queries
- âœ… Statistical aggregations (averages, totals)
- âœ… Industry and city clustering
- âœ… AI-generated insights and recommendations
- âœ… Sample results with real company data

### Backend Agentic Pipeline (Optional)
The branch also includes a complete backend pipeline for advanced analysis:
- Company segmentation using clustering
- Feature engineering for ML scoring
- Market and financial analysis automation
- Quality checks and validation

To test the backend pipeline:
```bash
cd backend
source ../venv/bin/activate
python run_agentic_targeting_pipeline.py --db-path ../allabolag.db --top 30
```

## Test Checklist

### Frontend Tests
- [ ] Navigate to "AI-insikter" page
- [ ] Try template query: "High growth tech companies"
- [ ] Try custom query: "Companies in Stockholm with high revenue"
- [ ] Verify real company names appear (not demo data)
- [ ] Check that financial metrics display correctly
- [ ] Review AI-generated insights for relevance
- [ ] Test filtering by industry, city, revenue
- [ ] Verify pagination works for large result sets
- [ ] Check that recommendations make sense

### Backend Tests (Optional)
- [ ] Run the agentic pipeline script
- [ ] Check output files in `outputs/agentic_targeting/`
- [ ] Verify CSV export contains segmented companies
- [ ] Review Excel file with detailed analysis
- [ ] Check database tables were updated

## Known Limitations

1. **Enrichment Fields Not Available**
   - The Supabase table doesn't have: `digital_maturity`, `company_size_category`, `employee_size_category`, `profitability_category`, `growth_category`, `fit_score_reason`
   - These fields are set to `null` in the interface for now
   - Main branch may have these in local SQLite but not in Supabase

2. **AI Analysis is Rule-Based**
   - Current implementation uses statistical aggregations and heuristics
   - Not using actual OpenAI API calls for insights (those are in backend pipeline)
   - Insights are generated from data patterns

3. **Sample Size**
   - Dashboard analytics samples up to 2,500 companies for performance
   - Company search uses pagination (20 per page)
   - AI analysis returns top 100 matches, shows 10 samples

## Comparison with Production

### Differences from Main Branch
- **Main:** Uses columns that exist in local SQLite
- **Test:** Adapted to match Supabase schema
- **Missing:** Enrichment columns not migrated to Supabase

### Same as Production
- Core company data (names, addresses, financials)
- KPI calculations (SDI, DR, ORS, growth, margins)
- Basic filtering and search
- Authentication and authorization

## Next Steps

### If Tests Pass
1. Document any issues or improvements needed
2. Consider merging to main (after fixing column schema differences)
3. Or keep as separate feature branch for AI-specific work

### If Tests Fail
1. Note specific failures (which queries, what errors)
2. Check browser console for error messages
3. Verify network tab shows successful API calls
4. Share findings for debugging
